#### Code snippets ####
On this page, we collect code snippets because they have been used
in a paper, or because they illustrate how things can be programmed.

- the file [civr.R](http://lavaan.org/resources/civr7.R) contains the civr()
  function for the estimation of the causal instrumental variables
  regression (CIVR) model (see the papers of Maydeu-Olivares and colleagues)
