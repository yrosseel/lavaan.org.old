#### lavaan is free ####

The lavaan package is free (as in beer) and open-source. We very much plan to
keep it that way. But the [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of the lavaan project is (currently) one, and the main developer (Yves 
Rosseel) finds it increasingly more difficult to find time to
maintain (let alone further develop) lavaan. 

At the same time, the number of lavaan users continues to grow, and lavaan has
become 'critical software' in many research domains.

This is not a sustainable situation, and we are looking for ways to hire more 
staff to support the lavaan project. One avenue is to ask for donations.

#### Donations ####

From 1 July 2023 onwards, it is possible to donate money to the lavaan project.
The money will go to [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/schenken/en), and
will be used exclusively to hire staff (at the post-doc level) that will
support the lavaan project.

If you are using lavaan for your project (and you have project money), or if
you are using lavaan for your business or organization, we would be very
grateful if you would consider a donation. Of course, individual donations are
welcome too.

Once we have been succesful in raising enough money to hire additional staff,
donators will be eligible for direct support, and custom feature requests.

At the end of the year, we will list all
individuals/projects/businesses/organizations that have made a donation (unless
they opt out) on this website.


#### What are the donations for? ####

Our initial goal is to raise about 120,000 euro (the gross salary of a
post-doc in Flanders) to hire a qualified person for 1 full year (hopefully,
starting early 2024). 

This person will assist the main developer to:

1. create high-quality documentation for users, 
2. create detailed technical documentation (matching the code), and 
3. create a public cloud-based quality-testing platform to ensure
the correctness of the lavaan output (in particular after a new update).
4. add new features to lavaan

#### How to make a donation ####

For the time being, donations can only be made by bank transfer using the following details:

- Beneficiary: UNIVERSITEIT GENT
- IBAN: BE26 3900 9658 0329 (remove spaces if necessary)
- Swift code (BIC): BBRUBEBB
- Bank reference: FWUGENTPP1226 

Please don't forget the bank reference (FWUGENTPP1226), otherwise, the money
will go to the University, but not to the lavaan project.
