The lavaan package is available on CRAN. Therefore, to
install lavaan, simply start up R, and type in the R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("lavaan", dependencies = TRUE)
```

You can check if the installation was succesful by typing

```{r eval=TRUE, comment=""}
library(lavaan)
```

A startup message will be displayed showing the
version number (always report this in your papers), and a reminder that 
this is free software. If you see this message, you are ready to start.
