By and large, structural equation models are used to model the
covariance matrix of the observed variables in a dataset. But in some
applications, it is useful to bring in the means of the observed
variables too. One way to do this is to explicitly refer to intercepts
in the lavaan syntax. This can be done by including `intercept formulas'
in the model syntax. An intercept formula has the following form:

\begin{verbatim}
variable ~ 1
\end{verbatim}

The left part of the expression contains the name of the observed or
latent variable. The right part contains the number \texttt{1},
representing the intercept. For example, in the three-factor H\&S CFA
model, we can add the intercepts of the observed variables as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
# three-factor model
   visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3
  textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
  speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9
# intercepts
  x1 ~ 1
  x2 ~ 1
  x3 ~ 1
  x4 ~ 1
  x5 ~ 1
  x6 ~ 1
  x7 ~ 1
  x8 ~ 1
  x9 ~ 1
\end{verbatim}

However, it is more convenient to omit the intercept formulas in the
model syntax (unless you want to fix their values), and to add the
argument \texttt{meanstructure\ =\ TRUE} in the fitting function. For
example, we can refit the three-factor H\&S CFA model as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fit <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{cfa}\NormalTok{(HS.model, }
           \DataTypeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ HolzingerSwineford1939, }
           \DataTypeTok{meanstructure =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\KeywordTok{summary}\NormalTok{(fit)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

As you can see in the output, the model includes intercept parameters
for both the observed and latent variables. By default, the
\texttt{cfa()} and \texttt{sem()} functions fix the latent variable
intercepts (which in this case correspond to the latent \emph{means}) to
zero. Otherwise, the model would not be estimable. Note that the
chi-square statistic and the number of degrees of freedom is the same as
in the original model (without a mean structure). The reason is that we
brought in some new data (a mean value for each of the 9 observed
variables), but we also added 9 additional parameters to the model (an
intercept for each of the 9 observed variables). The end result is an
identical fit. In practice, the only reason why a user would add
intercept-formulas in the model syntax, is because some constraints must
be specified on them. For example, suppose that we wish to fix the
intercepts of the variables \texttt{x1}, \texttt{x2}, \texttt{x3} and
\texttt{x4} to, say, 0.5. We would write the model syntax as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
# three-factor model
   visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3
  textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
  speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9
# intercepts with fixed values
  x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 ~ 0.5*1
\end{verbatim}

where we have used the left-hand side of the formula to `repeat' the
right-hand side for each element of the left-hand side.
