If you have no full dataset, but you do have a sample covariance matrix, you
can still fit your model. If you wish to add a mean structure, you need to
provide a mean vector too. Importantly, if only sample statistics are provided,
you must specify the number of observations that were used to compute the
sample moments. The following example illustrates the use of a sample
covariance matrix as input. First, we read in the lower half of the
covariance matrix (including the diagonal):

```{r tidy=FALSE}
lower <- '
 11.834
  6.947   9.364
  6.819   5.091  12.532
  4.783   5.028   7.495   9.986
 -3.839  -3.889  -3.841  -3.625  9.610
-21.899 -18.831 -21.748 -18.775 35.522 450.288 '

wheaton.cov <- 
    getCov(lower, names = c("anomia67", "powerless67", 
                            "anomia71", "powerless71",
                            "education", "sei"))
```

The `getCov()` function makes it easy to create a full covariance matrix
(including variable names) if you only have the lower-half elements (perhaps
pasted from a textbook or a paper). Note that the lower-half elements are
written between two single quotes. Therefore, you have some additional
flexibility. You can add comments, and blank lines. If the numbers are
separated by a comma, or a semi-colon, that is fine too. For more information
about `getCov()`, see the online manual page.

Next, we can specify our model, estimate it, and request a summary
of the results:

```{r tidy=FALSE, comment=""}
# classic wheaton et al. model
wheaton.model <- '
  # latent variables
    ses     =~ education + sei
    alien67 =~ anomia67 + powerless67
    alien71 =~ anomia71 + powerless71
  # regressions
    alien71 ~ alien67 + ses
    alien67 ~ ses
  # correlated residuals
    anomia67 ~~ anomia71
    powerless67 ~~ powerless71
'
fit <- sem(wheaton.model, 
           sample.cov = wheaton.cov, 
           sample.nobs = 932)
summary(fit, standardized = TRUE)
```

#### The `sample.cov.rescale` argument ####

If the estimator is `ML` (the default), then the sample variance-covariance
matrix will be rescaled by a factor (N-1)/N. The reasoning is the following:
the elements in a sample variance-covariance matrix have (usually) been
divided by N-1. But the (normal-based) ML estimator would divide the elements
by N. Therefore, we need to rescale. If you don't want this to happen (for
example in a simulation study), you can
provide the argument `sample.cov.rescale = FALSE`.

#### Multiple groups ####

If you have multiple groups, the `sample.cov` argument must be a list
containing the sample variance-covariance matrix of each group as a separate
element in the list. If a mean structure is needed, the `sample.mean` argument
must be a list containing the sample means of each group. Finally, the
`sample.nobs` argument can be either a list or an integer vector containing the
number of observations for each group.
