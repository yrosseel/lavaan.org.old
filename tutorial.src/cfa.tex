We start with a simple example of confirmatory factor analysis, using
the \texttt{cfa()} function, which is a user-friendly function for
fitting CFA models. The lavaan package contains a built-in dataset
called \texttt{HolzingerSwineford1939}. See the help page for this
dataset by typing

\begin{verbatim}
?HolzingerSwineford1939
\end{verbatim}

at the R prompt. This is a `classic' dataset that is used in many papers
and books on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The data consists of
mental ability test scores of seventh- and eighth-grade children from
two different schools (Pasteur and Grant-White). In our version of the
dataset, only 9 out of the original 26 tests are included. A CFA model
that is often proposed for these 9 variables consists of three latent
variables (or factors), each with three indicators:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a \emph{visual} factor measured by 3 variables: \texttt{x1},
  \texttt{x2} and \texttt{x3}
\item
  a \emph{textual} factor measured by 3 variables: \texttt{x4},
  \texttt{x5} and \texttt{x6}
\item
  a \emph{speed} factor measured by 3 variables: \texttt{x7},
  \texttt{x8} and \texttt{x9}
\end{itemize}

The figure below contains a graphical representation of the three-factor
model.

\includegraphics{figure/cfa-1.pdf} The corresponding lavaan syntax for
specifying this model is as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
 visual =~ x1 + x2 + x3
textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
  speed =~ x7 + x8 + x9
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the model syntax only contains three `latent variable
definitions'. Each formula has the following format:

\begin{verbatim}
latent variable =~ indicator1 + indicator2 + indicator3
\end{verbatim}

We call these expressions \emph{latent variable definitions} because
they define how the latent variables are `indicated by' a set of
(typically observed) variables, often called `indicators'. Note that the
special ``\texttt{=\textasciitilde{}"} operator in the middle consists
of a sign (''\texttt{=}``) character and a tilde
(\texttt{"\textasciitilde{}"}) character next to each other. The reason
why this model syntax is so short, is that behind the scenes, the
\texttt{cfa()} function will take care of several things. First, by
default, the factor loading of the first indicator of a latent variable
is fixed to 1, thereby fixing the scale of the latent variable. Second,
residual variances are added automatically. And third, all exogenous
latent variables are correlated by default. This way, the model syntax
can be kept concise. On the other hand, the user remains in control,
since all this `default' behavior can be overriden and/or switched off.

We can enter the model syntax using the single quotes:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{HS.model }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{} visual  =\textasciitilde{} x1 + x2 + x3 }
\StringTok{              textual =\textasciitilde{} x4 + x5 + x6}
\StringTok{              speed   =\textasciitilde{} x7 + x8 + x9 \textquotesingle{}}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

We can now fit the model as follows:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{fit }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{cfa}\NormalTok{(HS.model, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ HolzingerSwineford1939)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The \texttt{cfa()} function is a dedicated function for fitting
confirmatory factor analysis models. The first argument is the
user-specified model. The second argument is the dataset that contains
the observed variables. Once the model has been fitted, the
\texttt{summary()} function provides a nice summary of the fitted model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(fit, }\AttributeTok{fit.measures =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

The output should look familiar to users of other SEM software. If you
find it confusing or esthetically unpleasing, please let us know, and we
will try to improve it.

The output consists of three parts. The first nine lines are called
\emph{the header}. The header contains the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the lavaan version number
\item
  did optimization end normally or not, and how many iterations were
  needed
\item
  the estimator that was used (here: \texttt{ML}, for maximum
  likelihood)
\item
  the optimizer that was used to find the best fitting parameter values
  for this estimator (here: \texttt{NLMINB})
\item
  the number of model parameters (here: \texttt{21})
\item
  the number of observations that were effectively used in the analysis
  (here: \texttt{301})
\item
  a section called \texttt{Model\ Test\ User\ Model:} which provides a
  test statistic, degrees of freedom, and a p-value for the model that
  was specified by the user.
\end{itemize}

The next section contains additional fit measures, and is only shown
because we use the optional argument \texttt{fit.measures\ =\ TRUE}. It
starts with the line \texttt{Model\ Test\ Baseline\ Model:} and ends
with the value for the \texttt{SRMR}. The last section contains the
parameter estimates. It starts with (technical) information about the
method that was used to compute the standard errors. (Most users can
safely ignore this information). Then, it tabulates all free (and fixed)
parameters that were included in the model. Typically, first the latent
variables are shown, followed by covariances and (residual) variances.
The first column (\texttt{Estimate}) contains the (estimated or fixed)
parameter value for each model parameter; the second column
(\texttt{Std.err}) contains the standard error for each estimated
parameter; the third column (\texttt{Z-value}) contains the Wald
statistic (which is simply obtained by dividing the parameter value by
its standard error), and the last column
(\texttt{P(\textgreater{}\textbar{}z\textbar{})}) contains the p-value
for testing the null hypothesis that the parameter value equals zero in
the population.

Note that in the \texttt{Variances:} section, there is a dot before the
observed variables names. This is because they are dependent (or
endogenous) variables (predicted by the latent variables), and
therefore, the value for the variance that is printed in the output is
an estimate of the residual variance: the left-over variance that is not
explained by the predictor(s). By contrast, there is no dot before the
latent variable names, because they are exogenous variables in this
model (there are no single-headed arrows pointing to them). The values
for the variances here are the estimated \emph{total} variances of the
latent variables.

To wrap up this first example, we summarize the complete code that was
needed to fit this three-factor model:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{\# load the lavaan package (only needed once per session)}
\FunctionTok{library}\NormalTok{(lavaan)}

\CommentTok{\# specify the model}
\NormalTok{HS.model }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \StringTok{\textquotesingle{} visual  =\textasciitilde{} x1 + x2 + x3      }
\StringTok{              textual =\textasciitilde{} x4 + x5 + x6}
\StringTok{              speed   =\textasciitilde{} x7 + x8 + x9 \textquotesingle{}}

\CommentTok{\# fit the model}
\NormalTok{fit }\OtherTok{\textless{}{-}} \FunctionTok{cfa}\NormalTok{(HS.model, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ HolzingerSwineford1939)}

\CommentTok{\# display summary output}
\FunctionTok{summary}\NormalTok{(fit, }\AttributeTok{fit.measures =} \ConstantTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

Simply copying this code and pasting it in R should work. The syntax
illustrates the typical workflow in the lavaan package:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Specify your model using the lavaan model syntax. In this example,
  only \emph{latent variable definitions} have been used. In the
  following examples, other formula types will be used.
\item
  Fit the model. This requires a dataset containing the observed
  variables (or alternatively the sample covariance matrix and the
  number of observations). In this example, we have used the
  \texttt{cfa()} function. Other functions in the lavaan package are
  \texttt{sem()} and \texttt{growth()} for fitting full structural
  equation models and growth curve models respectively. All three
  functions are so-called user-friendly functions, in the sense that
  they take care of many details automatically, so we can keep the model
  syntax simple and concise. If you wish to fit non-standard models or
  if you don't like the idea that things are done for you automatically,
  you can use the lower-level function \texttt{lavaan()} instead, where
  you have full control.
\item
  Extract information from the fitted model. This can be a long verbose
  summary, or it can be a single number only (say, the RMSEA value). In
  the spirit of R, you only get what you asked for. We try to not print
  out unnecessary information that you would ignore anyway.
\end{enumerate}
