Since the release of version 0.3-1, many people have provided valuable
feedback, comments and suggestions. Below is an (incomplete) list of people
that somehow contributed to the development of lavaan:

- Patrick Mair (for immediately adding lavaan to the Psychometrics Task View)
- Michael Hallquist (author of the MplusAutomation package, used for testing lavaan)
- Holger Steinmetz and Joerg Evermann: two early adaptors; their feedback helped shape the 0.4 version of lavaan
- [William Revelle](http://www.personality-project.org/revelle.html) (author of the psych package; the diagram() functions draws a path diagram of a fitted lavaan object)
- [Sacha Epskamp](http://sachaepskamp.com/) (author of the qgraph and semPlot packages with great support for lavaan)
- [Gerhard Arminger](http://www.statistik.uni-wuppertal.de/startseite/mitarbeiter/univ-prof-dr-gerhard-arminger.html) (provided the MECOSA source code, in the GAUSS language)
- (and many, many others)
