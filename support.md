#### Asking for help ####
If you are looking for help, please do not email me directly. Please use the
lavaan discussion group instead.

#### lavaan discussion group ####
If you have questions about the use of lavaan, or if you would like to discuss
various aspects about the lavaan package, please join the the lavaan discussion
group:

[https://groups.google.com/d/forum/lavaan](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/lavaan)

Once you have joined the group, you can email your questions (or opinions) to
<lavaan@googlegroups.com>

This discussion group is the main hub for the lavaan community. Announcements
related to lavaan will be posted there first. And discussions may lead to
changes in the lavaan code. The discussion group is archived, and can be
searched. It is always wise to check the archives first, before posting.

#### Reporting bugs ####

If you have found a (possible) bug, please report it. You can either:

1. email me directly (<Yves.Rosseel@UGent.be>) (to alert me)
2. create an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/yrosseel/lavaan/issues) (to remind me, once we have agreed it is a bug)

But please, *always* include a reproducible example containing an R script, and
a snippet of your data (just enough to reproduce the issue). And make
sure you are using the latest version of lavaan.

All verified bugs (and other reported issues) are listed in the [version history](/history/index.html).
