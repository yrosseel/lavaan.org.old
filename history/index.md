#### Version History ####
Reproducibility of scientific results is important. In this section, we 
keep a record of all versions of lavaan that have been released
on CRAN. For each version, we briefly list the new features that were
introduced in that version, and (most importantly) the bugs and issues
that were reported for this version.
